2. Open a terminal for the source Jenkins server  and go to home dir
3. cd into Jobs folder
4. Type ls to see available jobs 
5. cd into the folder of the job you want to copy / move
6. You will see config.xml ( this needs to be copied to another server) Note: This is optional only if you want to copy job without build info
7.Copy entire folder into other machine using the scp command
8. run the command below:
scp -r  Job_Name user@targetip:destination_Path
9. Go to Target Jenkins (front End) click Manage Jenkins >>> Click Reload Configuration From Disk and click Ok
